# Design assets

This folder stores UI redesign assets (images, icons, mockups) used by the Krigzis Web project.

Guidelines:
- Only commit static, non-sensitive files (e.g., .png, .jpg, .svg, .webp, .gif)
- Prefer optimized images (compress when possible)
- Keep any source/editable files out of the repo if they are large or proprietary
- Original source was `Nova pasta/` (ignored by Git); assets are copied here for use in the app
